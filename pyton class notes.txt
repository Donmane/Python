to convert integer to string name=str(integer)
in order to combine integer and string you need to convert and 
place like print('i am' + val + 'years old')

we call decimal float

Slice method
in order to slice more than one letter write like so (3:5)
in order to capture everything from the initial number you choose
to everything is (3:)
if you have name=mondays
in order to get day you need to write (3:6)
if you use a negative num ber it counts from the back
in order to check the length print (len(name))
in order to use comment you need to add """ at the begining and 3 space at the end and """
in order to check if the first word is what you imagined you need
to write print(comment.startswith('commented')) if it is the 
terminal will show true and vise versa
while endswith is the opposite but same result
+ sign dosen't work with combining string and integer but , works


Strip method
in order to use strip you need to write like print('length before strip is' , len(comment.strip()))
 

Python Arimetic operation
operator     name               
+             addition
-             subtraction
/             division
%             modulus
**            exponentiation raise to power
//            floor division the main answer

in order to use input on the terminal write as
val= int(input('enter value for val2: '))

Assignment operators
== if the value is equal the statement becomes true
!= if the value are not equal the statement is true
<= if the first value if less than or equal to the second value the statement is true
>= if the first value if greater than or equal to the second value the statement is true
> if the first value if greater than the second value the statement is true
< if the first value if less than the second value the statement is true

Lower() function : it puts the variable in lower case
in order to activate
print (name.lower())
and verse versa

The replace function replaces one word with another
mwe = comment.replace("people", "student")

Split it creates a list it can be changed wherever you want the list to occure
print(comment.split('.'))

Join is the opposite of split 
print("".join(value))
full descloure
the signs can be changed

title the first letter of a word will have capital letter

/n is br for python

Count it counts how many times a word appeares in a variable  
print(comment.count("python"))

Format it putes words and numbers in a variable
name = "psof"
num = 90
comment  = """ {name} ereregrrege {num}   """
print(comment.format(name, num))

Array
List is a collection which is ordered and changeable
List is created with [] or ()
you can have integers,decimal and etc inside a list
when using ()
write list()
you cannot use replace under list
Append :to add name write mylist.append("val")
Insert : specifies where you want the new ward to be placed
  

              HLW
strip the comment
Split it 
add append and insert



Extend it combines two lists
Remove is to remove a word from the list
Pop is to delete val.pop(index)
clear it empties the list
del deletes everything including the list
sort it arranges index from smallest to biggest
it can also arrange from biggest to smallest
like so 
val.sort(reverse=true)
inverse starts fro m the back
copy copies a list from another variable
val1 = [e,t,hh]
val2 = val1.copy()
max and min checkes the maximum and mininum of the integer of a list
print(max(val))


     Tuple
its an order but not changeable
1 means true
0 means false


HLW
use all the list method
if counting length start from 1 
index is zero


      Set
set is a collection which is not ordered
it is written in curly brackets
i.e {} or set()
it picks one one string  with the same name
it starts counting from one
if you try to add it puts it anywhere
update joins the sets together
val.update(val)
updatea add more items
pop ramdomly selects which deletes
for in
union is to add(2 sets or more) everything together
set3 = set1.union(set2)
symethric difference it shows what is not in set 1 but in set 2
and verse vice
and you need to create another variable

symethric differenceupdate it picks what is not in  set 1 and but in set2
and vice versa into a set
isdisjoint is true when they don't have any element in common
issubset is true when everything in set 1 is in set 2
 issupersect is true when set3 is the parent of set 1

Dictionary are used to store data values with 
Key : value pairs
Key is used as a variable name
while value pairs is used as the variable
but they will still be written as val {key:value pairs}
dictionaries are ordered and changeable
they cannot have two items with the same key
the data type of a dictionary is 'dist

. get

in order to add to the disc 
val.["key"] = 'ten'
.item will place them in their own individual brackets
you can use the update function to add and change


f*= i is the same as f = f*1


Loop is a statement that repeats the same instruction until a condition is met
Nested loop is a loop in a loop

to stop while loop put brake

remove the  even and odd and prime

when using break it stops before the given value


when using  it continue to one extra val the given value

pass stops the whole operation when the condition is met

in order to start a function it needs to start with def

def fun(argument,argument)
or
(*arg):
print()

you can call one fun in another

  fun() overides anything that has been set as defalt
calculator through function


Keyword argument you have to specify which is which when calling the function
in default it gives its value depending on the index and in the creation of the function

in order to change when an error appers write as 
try:
     FUNCTION NAME()
except TypeError:
    print()

put the function inside try

args are non keyword
kwargs are keyword
* = unpacking

return =
